# 🏡 House Price Prediction using XGBoost  
**Replication & Extension of “An Optimal House Price Prediction Algorithm: XGBoost”**

This repository contains a Machine Learning project that replicates and extends the research paper *"An Optimal House Price Prediction Algorithm: XGBoost"* by Hemlata Sharma et al. The aim is to validate the paper’s findings using the same dataset and then apply the same methodology on a different dataset to assess generalizability and performance across regions.

## 📘 About the Project

The project consists of two parts:

1. **Replication Study** – Reproduces the methodology from the original research using the **USA Housing Dataset**.
2. **Extension Study** – Applies the same ML pipeline on the **Indian Housing Dataset** to discover region-specific insights.

The study involves multiple regression algorithms including **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, **Linear Regression**, **Lasso**, **Ridge**, and **Decision Tree Regressors** for comparative analysis.
